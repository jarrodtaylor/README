Biden has decided not to run for reelection. He's choosing his country over his party and over his ego.
Better to burn out than to fade away.

I'm as meh on Biden as I've been on most of our recent presidents. I think he's too focused on compromise.
And that's okay. What I want from a president is simple -- _make good decisions in the best interest
of the country_. It doesn't have to be perfect, just keep things heading mostly in the right direction.
We can always course correct as we go. And all the recent presidents, with one glaring exception^1^,
have more or less done that.

So what's next? It has to be Harris, right? I'm excited to see how the country responds to a new candidate.
She's not perfect, but she does seem to want to move the country in the right direction. And since the
opposition is resorting [fascism](https://www.project2025.org) instead of good ideas, a new challenger
could be just what we need.

Also, vote. It _does_ matter.
