The Beaverton is on point:

> It’s not exactly clear why the Oilers are so determined to become the team everyone who isn’t a piece of shit hates,
> but insiders agree that is the only logical explanation for their actions here.

Stan Bowman's main talent seems to be inheriting already good hockey teams. I doubt him, Quenneville, or McDonough
have learned anything from any of this because I don't think they think they did anything wrong and
apparently neither does the NHL. The least they can do is stay retired.

Brad Aldrich, on the other hand, should be in prison.

**Update**: The Hockey Guy sums it up pretty well.
