My friend [Richard][richard] is getting pretty good at this YouTube thing.

From the video description:

> Follow along as Richard tells the story of his second attempt to win @imogeneandwillie's Pinewood Derby.
> Wanting redemption from scrubbing out in his first race last year, Richard is determined to win this year.
> Design, build, paint, assembly, and race results all lie within.
