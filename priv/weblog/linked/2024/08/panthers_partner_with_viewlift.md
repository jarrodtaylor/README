Thankfully the Panthers kept their broadcast team together after Bally's went under and Scripps Sports took over.

Now they're teaming up with ViewLift to offer a streaming service to local fans. There are still a few
unanswered questions.

> Panthers fans in South Florida and the surrounding region will now have unparalleled access to live
> game content along with on-demand video and original shoulder programs, whether they are at home or on the go.

Will this require an additional cable subscription? Will it work from outside the South Florida area?
Can we watch games after they've aired?

Sports streaming is a clusterfuck these days. Hopefully this is a step in the right direction
and not a panic move to replace Bally's. I don't mind paying for access but it needs to easier.
Here's what I'd like to see:

1. Each team should have their own in-house broadcast team. TV/streaming video, radio, podcast, all of it.
2. The league should handle distribution by partnering with someone who knows how to handle sports broadcasting.
   ESPN, YouTube, Amazon, someone big.
3. Together, they should offer two simple packages --
   watch all the games for just your team or watch all the games league-wide.

Bonus points for making the "just your team's games" package a no-cost perk for season ticket holders.

Now if we could do something about the awful playoff coverage...
