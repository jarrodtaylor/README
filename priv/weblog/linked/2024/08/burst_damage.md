Ed Zitron has been doing stellar work tracking the AI bubble:

> Goldman Sachs put out a report in July that said that generative AI was too expensive and didn't
> solve the complex problems that it would need to to justify said expenses. Just over a week ago,
> Gartner put out a report predicting that 30% of Generative AI projects would be abandoned after a
> proof of concept by End of 2025, and the Washington Post reports that Barclays bank thinks that
> "Wall Street analysts are expecting Big Tech companies to spend around $60 billion a year on developing
> AI models by 2026, but reap only around $20 billion a year in revenue from AI by that point."

Simply put, there's way more money going into large language generative AI than will likely ever be
recouped, the startups developing it are promising things they will never be able to deliver, and
the companies bankrolling the whole grift are having a harder time justifying the expense to investors.

Something's gotta give. Ed Zitron lists a number of scenarios to watch out for. I'm waiting for
one of the major players to signal they're done. I think they're all playing a game of billionaire's
chicken right now, just waiting for someone to blink. The first to go will give the others
permission/cover to follow. Nvidia shareholders will be left holding the bag.
