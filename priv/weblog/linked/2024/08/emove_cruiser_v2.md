If you live in the suburbs, chances are you drive everywhere. Here in sunny South Florida, 95%+
of the population lives in the suburbs. Public transport is barely a thing. Everyone drives everywhere.
As a car guy, that's one of the things I like about the suburbs. Growing up, driving meant freedom.

These days most of my trips are less than 10 miles. Parking, traffic and indirect routes are the biggest
part of short drives. They suck all the fun out of it.

So for the past few years I've been replacing nearly all my short drives with scooter rides. I never have
to deal with traffic. I can always park at a bike rack by the door. I can ride on roads _and_ sidewalks.
I can cut through neighborhoods and trails. It really is that same feeling of freedom I had when I started driving.

After owning way too many different scooters, I've learned what works and what doesn't.
25 mph for 40+ miles on a charge, a single motor with a smooth accelerator, nimble enough for sidewalks,
water proof-ish for surprise rain, and just enough minor off roading ability to get around bicyclists
who refuse to give way. Forget the folding handlebars and the 45+ mph top speeds.

Voro Motors may have just released exactly that for way less money than even a junk car. It looks
like the sweet spot between the Emove Cruiser V1 and Kaabo Mantis King GT.
